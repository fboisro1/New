            <p>In Egyptian society men and women commonly had clean shaven or close cropped hair and often wore wigs. The
                ancient Egyptians created the wig to shield shaved, hairless heads from the sun. They also wore the wigs on
                top of their hair using beeswax and resin to keep the wigs in place. Wealthy Egyptians would wear elaborate
                wigs and scented cones of animal fat on top of their wigs. Other ancient cultures, including the Assyrians,
                Phoenicians, Jews in ancient Israel, Greeks and Romans, also used wigs as an everyday fashion.</p>

            <p>In the past, wigs were seen as a symbol of aristocracy but today wigs have transformed to become an
                    everyday item worn by the every day woman to simply express her personal style.</p>
