            <h3>Army</h3>
            <p id="aboutMe">I graduated from Florida Atlantic University in 2013 and joined the United States Army in 2014. Since then I have been stationed in Oklahoma, Texas, and finally Washington. <br><br>
                Being stationed here in Washington has allowed me the opportunity to meet great people who work in the tech industry and now I have been inspired to pursue my dreams in computer science. <br><br> I was discharged from the Army in 2017 and decided to stay in the area to tackle this new challenge head on.</p>
                
                <p id="aboutMe">During my childhood I watched how important hair had been to the women in my household. I would constantly see my mother doing my sisters hair and my sisters doing my mothers hair.<br><br>  As time went on I started to see the importance of hair wasn't just a characteristic that my family had but in fact it was cultural thing. </p>
