        <p>Cornrows or braids, also called canerows in the Caribbean, are an ancient traditional African style of hair
            grooming, in which the hair is braided very close to the scalp, using an underhand, upward motion to
            produce a continuous, raised row. Cornrows are often formed in simple, straight lines, as the name implies,
            but they can also be formed in complicated geometric or curvilinear designs.

            Depending on the region of the world, cornrows are worn by men or women, or both, and are sometimes adorned
            with beads or cowry shells. Often favored for their easy maintenance, rows can be left in for weeks at a
            time if maintained through careful washing of the hair and regular oiling of the scalp. </p>
